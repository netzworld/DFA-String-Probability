Problem Description:

Given two strings x and y of the same length N over a finite alphabet Σ of size M.
(N and M are user inputs so your solution should work for arbitrary N and M.)
Consider a game involving two players A and B. A random string over the alphabet Σ is generated until x or y appears.
(You can assume that x and y do not have a common prefix (other than the null string.)
If the game terminates with the appearance of x (y), player 1 (2) wins.
This program takes as input the strings x and y and outputs the probability that A wins.


Please See "CS 454 Project Writeup.pdf" for an in-depth report on the Program.
This report includes an analysis of the algorithm used with time complexity, a description of the Input and Output with Examples, and pseudo code summarizing the function calls and "steps" the program makes
